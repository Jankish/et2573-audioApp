\emph{Voice Activity Detector} (VAD) is a technique used in signal
processing to detect the presence of human voice in a signal. It is considered
an important technology in speech based communication and today we have various types
of applications that use it. Therefore various VAD algorithms have been developed 
to provide the needed features. 

There are different kind of stand-alone commercial baby monitor on the market today. 
From the most basic, that use one-way radio communication, to advance two-way communication
monitors that use signal processing to transmitt audio when a predefined threashold has been 
reached. It is also possible to find baby video monitors that broadcast both audio and video when 
the sensors notice movement. Since the monitor system relies on radio signals to 
communicate between the units there is a risk that the signal strength 
will weaken or possible even not reach the receiver becuase it needs to pass through multiple walls
of varying thickness. As the stand-alone monitor focuses on reliability, little is known 
about the security features. It is possible to assume that the communication is uncrypted,
in some products, and therefore introduces a potential risk for intrusion of peoples privacy. 

To resolve the issuses broughten up above, an application such as the BAD can can be made more 
portable, versatile and secure with the help of todays smartphone technology and VAD. There are
many VAD algorithms to choose from and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. 
are short-time energy, where energy levels are calculated 
for each frame to detect voice, unvoiced or silenced regions. Voiced regions will have 
higher energy levels. Zero-crossing rate (ZCR), is the rate at which a signal changes 
from plus to minus and back. The higher the rate the higher the frequency which indicates
voice activity. Linear predictive coding (LPC) is one of the most powerful speech
analysis techniques which gives an extremely accurate estimate of the speech parameters. 
The algorithm is very complex but the basic
