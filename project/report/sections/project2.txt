\section{Project 2}
A simple and easy VAD algorithm to implement in software, since there are limited hardware resources
in a mobile phone, is the \emph{recursive averaging} which calculates the average power level for a
block of fragments from a discretized analog signal. The blocks should large enough to get calculate
an interval but small enough to quickly respond to changes in power amplitude. 
The advanced algorithm is based upon the first simple one, but added filtering to remove the noise
from the signal. [ADD MORE TEXT TO THIS! AREA]

The sample frequency for all of the provided files are 8 kHz.
