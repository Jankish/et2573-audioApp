Provided with this zip-folder are two .apk files. One is release and the other
one is debug. To run the student BAD (Baby Activity Detector) select 
"Student Detector" in the configuration view, after installing and running the
application. There are further instructions on why but also how to use the 
scaling bar provided.

As with the other detectors, simple tap on the screen once will start the
detector. There is a ~12 seconds intended delay. During this time, 
the application calculates the baseline. In other words, averages the 
noise levels and making the detector neglect it.

It is possible to adjust the sensitivity of the threshold at any given time
during the operation.
